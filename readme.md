## Project Overview

This repo is primarily for the programming/data science portion of the challenge, but can be used by anyone in the project.  If you're not familiar with Git or GitHub, please submit your work/notes via google docs in the google drive folder.

All participants should be added to the Google Team Drive.  Please submit your google email account to the slack channel to be added to the folder.  At the completion of the event, your access will be revoked from this Google Team Drive. You are welcome to keep a local copy of your work, but any copies of the original or generated data should be deleted upon completion of the event.

Due to the sensitive nature of the data that Cru is providing for this event, all participants are asked to delete any and all local copies of the data provided and generated during the event  by its completion.  Please do not post, share, or disclose this dataset or any generated derivative outside of the Predicting Professions Challenge participants.  Because we long for the gospel to continue to go out, because Cru often works in restricted areas, and because we long to love people well with the data, please respect these delete requests.

### Challenge Desription:

Advances in data science and computer science make it possible to use ministry data to help discover insights and draw new conclusions about how to more effectively reach the world with the gospel. Cru is working on a propensity model, such as an algorithm or equation, and a recommendation engine to help increase the conversion or growth rate for its evangelistic websites.

Given an anonymized set of clickstream data (40 million events from Cru.org), predict the likelihood that someone will engage with missional content, like a gospel presentation, and accept Christ.  Then use your prediction to build a recommendation engine to help them grow in their faith by recommending their next best step on their spiritual journey (i.e. read an article, attend an event, take a step of faith, etc).  Build predictive models that enable more people to engage with the Gospel and increase their likelihood to see and savor Christ.

How do we design better digital content based on our understanding of the people who visit these websites?
How do we ensure that we’re not hindering people from access to the gospel as they come to an evangelistic site but instead provide them with the right content at the right time?
How do we offer users the right content/experiences at the right time (on the website and in their walk with the Lord)

<a name="goals" />

### Primary Goals:
 * Build a propensity model for content engagement on Cru.org
 * Build a text classifier to label the content viewed on Cru.org based on topics
 * Build a recommender model based on the propensity model, text classifier, and given content attributes

### Aspirational / Stretch Goals:
 * Predict the pathways that have the highest likelihood for someone to accept Christ
 * Build a proposed content strategy for user journeys through the content to enhance the existing content and recommend future content
 * Build a theological / ethical positioning document describing the possibilities and challenges of using big data, predictive modeling, and personalization to do evangelism and discipleship online.

## Project Background
55% of the world’s population now uses the internet, and it’s growing 7% every year.  As more and more people are engaging in the digital world, a new mission field is growing.  We believe that if the goal of missions is to go where people are with the good news of Jesus, we need to send missionaries to the digital world.  That’s what we call Digital Missions. 

Cru Digital Missions aims to practice evangelism and discipleship in the digital world.  Because everyone is on a spiritual journey, we create websites, apps, and content that help each person take their next best step in their relationship with Christ.  We steward 100M+ visitors annually on our digital properties.  A few years ago, to focus all our efforts on helping people on their next best step, we began a project called “Known & Moving”, which seeks to <i>Know</i> people in a personal way online, to help them <i>Move</i> on their spiritual journey closer towards Christ.  

That often looks like <b>personalizing people's digital experiences to help them find the right resources/content for them</b>.  As an organization that has been producing resources to help people have life-changing experiences with Jesus for more than 60 years, we've ammased a large library of resources (online and offline content, events, experiences, etc.) that could help people on their spiritual journey, and we continue to produce new content daily.  In recent years, we've began to publish and disseminate our resources online via multiple websites, mobile-apps, and social media channels.  But with such a large library of content, it can be incredibly difficult for our users to find the right resources for their needs, which can mean the gospel isn't heard and our ministry impact is greatly diminished.

As part of our "Known & Moving" initiative, we began to consider how we can better personalize each user's experience.  But to do that, we need to better understand each user's preferences, interests, and goals.  We been aggregating user clickstream behaviors from a large number of our digital properties to build predictive models/algorithms and offer users their right next best step via recommendation enginges and personalization.  Ultimately, we want to help each person find the right content, at the right time, in the right way to help them take their next best step on their spiritual journey towards Christ.  

<b>Can you help Cru grow it's ability to offer *each person* their next best step on their spiritual journey as they visit any of our digital strategies - the places we do evangelism and discipleship online?  Use your skills in or passion for digital to help us see the fulfillment of the great commission through the internet and technology in this generation.</b>
